## About the App
AMAZAM is an online store that sells clothing, shoes, and accessories. The app provides an intuitive shopping experience where customers can view product information, navigate through related products, read and add reviews, and search and answer questions about the products listed.

### Background
Our team was tasked with re-creating the site from the ground up to modernize the look and feel of the site. We were provided with a business requirements document as well as wireframes (Adobe XD) from a design team for which we were then responsible for the implementing and stylizing.

We collaborated during our daily stand-ups, tracked tickets in Trello, and used Git Feature Branch Workflow to develop our own features without disturbing the main codebase. Our team successfully completed the project in under two weeks and presented it to the stakeholders.

#### Ratings and Review (Melissa)

### Reviews
The reviews section dynamically renders product reviews. The list can be expanded to display additional reviews. Review image thumbnails can be clicked on to show an enlarged image in a popup modal. Users have the option to report a review if deemed inappropriate OR can mark a review as helpful. All interactions provide user feedback for an engaging and responsive user experience.

### Reviews Filtering and Sorting
Reviews can sort by age of reviews (newest and oldest), helpfulness, and relevance. In addition, users can filter reviews for a specific rating.

### Add New Review
New reviews can be posted by users by filling out the 'Add A Review' form. Users select a rating by clicking a star from one to five, select the product characteristics, and upload images. I used [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for image hosting.

### Dark Mode
For ease of viewing, we added a dark mode by using an event click handler that renders a dark style CSS when the dark mode button is clicked.
