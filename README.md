## About the App
AMAZAM is an online store that sells clothing, shoes, and accessories. The app provides an intuitive shopping experience where customers can view product information, navigate through related products, read and add reviews, and search and answer questions about the products listed.

### Background
Our team was tasked with re-creating the site from the ground up to modernize the look and feel of the site. We were provided with a business requirements document as well as wireframes (Adobe XD) from a design team for which we were then responsible for the implementing and stylizing.

We collaborated during our daily stand-ups, tracked tickets in Trello, and used Git Feature Branch Workflow to develop our own features without disturbing the main codebase. Our team successfully completed the project in under two weeks and presented it to the stakeholders.
